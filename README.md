# SpeachRecognition
This repository contains the files for the project : Speach Recognition with Machine Learning

*  The notebook jupiter with the python code.
*  The report/inform with the details of the project.
*  The audioset used : http://www.openslr.org/45/

Some important additional notes are: 
 
 1  The Audio processing take at least 45 minutes
 2  The ensambing of the dataset into a csv file takes atleast 1 hour.

I think the time may vary according to the machine.
